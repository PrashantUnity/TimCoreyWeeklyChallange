# Text File Challenge
## Goal
	Load records from the StandardDataSet into the users list 
	(at least first and last name). 
	Then create a new record and save it to the list 
	and then the file.
## Bonus
	Load all columns from the StandardDataSet and then, 
	without changing any code except the text file name, 
	load the AdvancedDataSet and ensure the data all 
	goes in the correct columns. Ensure saving the data 
	correctly puts the data back in the text file in the 
	right column order.
