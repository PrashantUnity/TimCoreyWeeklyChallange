# Foreach Challange
## Goal

	  Create a Console app that has a List<string> 
	  populated with a set of names. 
	  Loop through the names using the foreach.
	  For every name, print it to the console.

## Bonus	
	  Instead of strings, make a class and create a set of 	  instances of that class instead.	  The class should store first and last names. 	  Use those properties when printing out the message 
	  on the console.
